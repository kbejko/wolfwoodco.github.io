# Work Flow for [wolfwoodco.com](http://www.wolfwoodco.com/) :dog2:

1. Create a .md file in the _furniture directory
2. Copy the front matter below and paste into here include the dashes ---
3. Then go the assets/img directory and add your image files here. I recommend naming them based on the file you added and image 1, 2, 3 and so on ex. coffee-table-walnut-img-1. Or you can create directories within the image directory and place the images into that folder. Whatever is easier
4. Go back to the file you created in the _furniture directory and replace the front matter data for each line after the colon. (ALL CAPS)
5. Make sure for each image (below there are 9 distinct ones) that the img-title, img-number, img-modal have distinct naming from eachother in this file as well as from other files in the _furniture directory. See the two examples in the _furniture directory.

Here's an example:


```

Make sure you optimize your images. They don't need to be any bigger than 800px. Another thing to do is upload them to [this site](https://imageoptim.com/mozjpeg) and upload here the images you get back.

We might also need to figure out some other way where to host your images because it looks like [Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) has a limit.

Anyway, that's all for now, bud. Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck :blush:

P.S. If anyone sees this and is interested in some fantastic hand-made furniture, give Joe a shout. He da best!!!

This was made with :sparkling_heart: by his friend [Klajdi](https://github.com/kbejko) who meeeses Joe and Alyssa and their pups Lilo and Bear very much
